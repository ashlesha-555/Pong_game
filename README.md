# Pong_game

A simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the Pong game, a classic arcade game. It features two paddles and a ball that bounces between them. Players control the paddles to hit the ball back and forth, trying to prevent the ball from passing their paddle while attempting to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

The game is created using Python's Turtle graphics library and demonstrates basic game development concepts.
